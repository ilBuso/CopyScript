# CopyScript

I picked up Unity for the first time when the quarantine first stated.
I already had in mind to create a video-game but I didn't know how to, so after some research and a lot of Dani's videos I decided to try unity.
In the free time I had, witch was a lot, I tried new things and ended up with a small game full of bugs.
Now, a few months after, with a fresh mind and some new skills acquired with the small projects I did after that game I am trying to remake it

P.S. sorry for the bad english
